Alright, so I've got this question about field extensions, and I need to find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q. The options are A. 0, B. 4, C. 2, D. 6. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the degree of a field extension is the dimension of the extension field as a vector space over the base field Q. So, in this case, I need to figure out how many elements are added to Q when we adjoin sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(18). But before that, maybe I should check if some of these elements are already in the field.

Let me recall that sqrt(18) can be simplified. Since 18 is 9*2, sqrt(18) is sqrt(9*2) which is 3*sqrt(2). So, sqrt(18) is just 3 times sqrt(2). That means sqrt(18) is already in Q(sqrt(2)). Therefore, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is actually the same as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) because sqrt(18) is redundant. So, that simplifies things a bit.

Now, I need to compute the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q. I know that for field extensions, the degree is the product of the degrees of each individual extension if they are separable and each is degree at least 2. So, let's find the degree of Q(sqrt(2)) over Q and the degree of Q(sqrt(3)) over Q.

The degree of Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is 2 because sqrt(2) is not in Q, and the minimal polynomial x² - 2 is irreducible over Q. Similarly, the degree of Q(sqrt(3)) over Q is also 2 because sqrt(3) is not in Q, and its minimal polynomial x² - 3 is irreducible over Q.

Since these extensions are both degree 2 and they are disjoint (they don't share any common elements beyond Q), the degree of the composite field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q should be the product of their degrees. So, 2 * 2 = 4. Therefore, the degree is 4.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Is Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) really equal to Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18))? Yes, because sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2), which is already in Q(sqrt(2)). So, adding sqrt(3) is the only new element we're adding beyond Q(sqrt(2)). So, the extension is Q(sqrt(2)) followed by sqrt(3), each of degree 2, so the total degree is 2*2=4.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The minimal polynomial for sqrt(2) is x² - 2, which is irreducible, and similarly for sqrt(3). Since sqrt(3) is not in Q(sqrt(2)), the extension is indeed degree 2 over Q(sqrt(2)). So, the total degree over Q is 4.

Therefore, the answer should be B. 4.

Alright, so I've got this question about field extensions, and I need to find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q. The options are A. 0, B. 4, C. 2, D. 6. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

Therefore, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is actually the same as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) because sqrt(18) is redundant. So, that simplifies things a bit.

Since these extensions are both degree 2 and they are disjoint (they don't share any common elements beyond Q), the degree of the composite field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q should be the product of their degrees. So, 2 * 2 = 4. Therefore, the degree is 4.

Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the index of the subgroup <p> in the symmetric group S_5, where p is given as the permutation (1,2,5,4)(2,3). The options are A.8, B.2, C.24, D.120. Hmm, okay, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the index of a subgroup H in a group G is the number of left cosets of H in G, which is equal to |G| / |H|. So, in this case, G is S_5, and H is the subgroup generated by the permutation p. Therefore, I need to find the order of the subgroup generated by p, which is the size of the cyclic group generated by p, and then divide the order of S_5 by that.

So, S_5 has 5 elements, so |S_5| is 120. Now, I need to find the order of <p> in S_5. The permutation p is given as (1,2,5,4)(2,3). Wait, hold on, that notation is a bit confusing. Let me parse it correctly. In permutation notation, when we write something like (a,b,c,d), that means it's a cycle. So, (1,2,5,4) would be a 4-cycle, right? But then it's followed by another part, (2,3), which is a transposition.

But wait, that can't be right because a single permutation can't have both a 4-cycle and a transposition unless they overlap in some way. Let me check: the permutation (1,2,5,4) is a cycle that moves 1→2, 2→5, 5→4, and 4→1. Then, the transposition (2,3) swaps 2 and 3. So, the entire permutation p is the combination of these two. But wait, how does that work? Because in permutation composition, we apply the cycles from right to left, right?

Wait, maybe I need to write p as the product of these cycles. So, p = (1,2,5,4)(2,3). So, first, we have the transposition (2,3), and then the 4-cycle (1,2,5,4). But since permutations are composed from right to left, the rightmost permutation is applied first. So, p would be the composition of (2,3) followed by (1,2,5,4). Let me see what that does.

Let me track where each element goes. Starting with 1: first apply (2,3), which leaves 1 unchanged. Then apply (1,2,5,4), which sends 1→2. So overall, 1→2.

Next, 2: first apply (2,3), which swaps 2↔3. So, 2→3. Then apply (1,2,5,4), which sends 3→... wait, 3 isn't in the cycle (1,2,5,4). So, does that mean 3 stays the same? But wait, the cycle is (1,2,5,4), so 1→2, 2→5, 5→4, 4→1. So, after swapping 2 and 3, when we apply the 4-cycle, 3 is not moved. So, 3 stays as 3.

Wait, but hold on, let's track 2 again. After applying (2,3), 2 becomes 3. Then, applying (1,2,5,4) to 3: since 3 is not in the cycle, it remains 3. So overall, 2→3.

Then, 3: first apply (2,3), which sends 3→2. Then apply (1,2,5,4) to 2, which sends 2→5. So, 3→5.

Next, 5: first apply (2,3), which leaves 5 unchanged. Then apply (1,2,5,4), which sends 5→4. So, 5→4.

Finally, 4: first apply (2,3), which leaves 4 unchanged. Then apply (1,2,5,4), which sends 4→1. So, 4→1.

So putting it all together, the permutation p is:

1→2

2→3

3→5

5→4

4→1

Wait, but that's a 5-cycle: 1→2→3→5→4→1. But that's not what was given. The original p was given as (1,2,5,4)(2,3). So, I must have made a mistake in composing the permutations.

Wait, actually, when you write permutations, the rightmost permutation is applied first. So, if p = (2,3)(1,2,5,4), then first apply (1,2,5,4), then apply (2,3). Let me try that.

So, first apply (1,2,5,4), which sends 1→2, 2→5, 5→4, 4→1.

Then apply (2,3), which swaps 2 and 3.

So, let's track each element:

1: first (1,2,5,4) sends 1→2. Then (2,3) sends 2→3. So overall, 1→3.

2: first (1,2,5,4) sends 2→5. Then (2,3) leaves 5 unchanged. So, 2→5.

5: first (1,2,5,4) sends 5→4. Then (2,3) leaves 4 unchanged. So, 5→4.

4: first (1,2,5,4) sends 4→1. Then (2,3) leaves 1 unchanged. So, 4→1.

3: first (1,2,5,4) leaves 3 unchanged. Then (2,3) sends 3→2. So, 3→2.

So the permutation p is:

1→3

2→5

3→2

4→1

5→4

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So, writing it as cycles, we have:

1→3, 3→2, 2→5, 5→4, 4→1. So that's a 5-cycle: (1,3,2,5,4). But that's a 5-cycle. So p is a 5-cycle.

Wait, but a 5-cycle is an element of order 5. So, in S_5, the order of a 5-cycle is 5, right? Because it takes 5 applications to get back to the identity.

Therefore, the subgroup generated by p is cyclic of order 5. So, |<p>| = 5.

Then, the index of <p> in S_5 is |S_5| / |<p>| = 120 / 5 = 24.

So the index is 24, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I correctly parse the permutation p? Because sometimes when you have multiple cycles, they can overlap in elements. In this case, p is given as (1,2,5,4)(2,3). So, that would mean it's a product of a 4-cycle and a transposition. But when you multiply them, they can interfere.

But in my initial approach, I considered p as (2,3)(1,2,5,4), which is the same as p = (1,2,5,4) followed by (2,3). But when I did that, I ended up with a 5-cycle. Alternatively, if I consider p as (1,2,5,4) followed by (2,3), which is a transposition, but perhaps the cycles interfere.

Wait, but in S_5, a 4-cycle and a transposition can generate a subgroup of order 10, but only if they are disjoint. However, in this case, the transposition (2,3) and the 4-cycle (1,2,5,4) are not disjoint because they both involve the element 2. So, their product would have a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the order of p directly. Let me compute the order of the permutation p. Since p is a product of a 4-cycle and a transposition, but they are not disjoint, so the order isn't simply the least common multiple of 4 and 2, which would be 4. But since they are not disjoint, the order could be higher.

Wait, but in my previous calculation, when I composed (1,2,5,4) and then (2,3), I ended up with a 5-cycle, which has order 5. So, that suggests that p has order 5. But that seems contradictory because a 4-cycle has order 4, and a transposition has order 2, and their product should have order lcm(4,2)=4, unless they interfere in a way that increases the order.

But in my calculation, p ended up being a 5-cycle, which has order 5. So perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me try again.

Let me write down the permutation step by step.

First, define p as (1,2,5,4)(2,3). So, p is the product of these two cycles.

In permutation multiplication, the rightmost cycle is applied first. So, first apply (1,2,5,4), then apply (2,3).

So, let's compute p step by step:

First, apply (1,2,5,4):

1→2

2→5

5→4

4→1

3→3

Then, apply (2,3):

2→3

3→2

So, let's compute the composition.

Let me track each element:

1: first (1,2,5,4) sends 1→2. Then (2,3) sends 2→3. So overall, 1→3.

2: first (1,2,5,4) sends 2→5. Then (2,3) leaves 5 unchanged. So, 2→5.

5: first (1,2,5,4) sends 5→4. Then (2,3) leaves 4 unchanged. So, 5→4.

4: first (1,2,5,4) sends 4→1. Then (2,3) leaves 1 unchanged. So, 4→1.

3: first (1,2,5,4) leaves 3 unchanged. Then (2,3) sends 3→2. So, 3→2.

So, the permutation p sends:

1→3

2→5

3→2

4→1

5→4

So, writing this as cycles, we have:

1→3→2→5→4→1.

That's a cycle of length 5: (1,3,2,5,4). So, p is a 5-cycle, which has order 5.

Therefore, the subgroup generated by p is cyclic of order 5, so |<p>| =5.

Thus, the index of <p> in S_5 is |S_5| / |<p>| =120 /5=24.

Therefore, the answer is C.24.

Wait, but let me think again. If p is a 5-cycle, then it's of order 5, so its cyclic subgroup has 5 elements. But sometimes, when you have overlapping cycles, the order can be different. Did I correctly compute the permutation p?

Yes, I think so. Let me confirm:

Start with 1:

p(1)=3

p(3)=2

p(2)=5

p(5)=4

p(4)=1

So, indeed, applying p five times brings us back to 1. So, the order is 5.

Therefore, the subgroup generated by p has order 5, and the index is 24.

So, the correct answer is C.24.

First, I remember that the index of a subgroup H in a group G is the number of left cosets of H in G, which is equal to |G| / |H|.

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all the zeros of the polynomial \(x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x\) in the finite field \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). Hmm, finite fields, also known as Galois fields, right? Specifically, \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) has elements 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since it's a finite field with 5 elements, every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.

The polynomial is of degree 5, so there should be at most 5 zeros in the field, but since it's over a finite field, it might have fewer. Let me try plugging in each element of \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) into the polynomial and see if it equals zero.

First, let's list the elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

I'll start with x=0:
\( f(0) = 0^5 + 3(0)^3 + (0)^2 + 2(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \)
So, 0 is a zero. That's one zero found.

Next, x=1:
\( f(1) = 1^5 + 3(1)^3 + (1)^2 + 2(1) = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7 \)
But in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), 7 mod 5 is 2. So, 2 ≠ 0. Therefore, 1 is not a zero.

Wait, that seems off. Let me recalculate:
\(1^5 = 1\)
\(3(1)^3 = 3\)
\(1^2 = 1\)
\(2(1) = 2\)
Adding them up: 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7. Yes, 7 mod 5 is 2. So, 1 is not a root.

Moving on to x=2:
\( f(2) = 2^5 + 3(2)^3 + (2)^2 + 2(2) \)
Calculating each term:
\(2^5 = 32\), but in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), 32 mod 5 is 2 (since 5*6=30, 32-30=2)
\(3(2)^3 = 3*8 = 24\), which mod 5 is 4 (since 24 - 5*4=24-20=4)
\(2^2 = 4\)
\(2*2 = 4\)
Adding them up: 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14
14 mod 5 is 4, since 5*2=10, 14-10=4. So, 4 ≠ 0. 2 is not a zero.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake in calculating 2^5. Let me double-check:
2^1 = 2
2^2 = 4
2^3 = 8 mod 5 is 3
2^4 = 16 mod 5 is 1
2^5 = 32 mod 5 is 2. Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, 2^3 is 8 mod 5 is 3. So 3*3=9 mod5 is 4. So that's correct.

So f(2)=2 +4 +4 +4=14 mod5=4≠0. So, 2 is not a root.

Next, x=3:
\( f(3) = 3^5 + 3(3)^3 + (3)^2 + 2(3) \)
Calculating each term:
3^5: Let's compute step by step:
3^1=3
3^2=9 mod5=4
3^3=12 mod5=2
3^4=6 mod5=1
3^5=3 mod5=3
So, 3^5 mod5=3.

3(3)^3: 3^3=27 mod5=2, so 3*2=6 mod5=1.

(3)^2=9 mod5=4.

2*3=6 mod5=1.

Adding them up: 3 +1 +4 +1=9 mod5=4≠0. So, 3 is not a root.

Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me verify each term again.

3^5: 3^1=3, 3^2=9≡4, 3^3=12≡2, 3^4=6≡1, 3^5=3. Yes, that's correct.

3*(3)^3: 3^3=27≡2, so 3*2=6≡1. Correct.

3^2=9≡4. Correct.

2*3=6≡1. Correct.

Total: 3 +1 +4 +1=9≡4. So, 4≠0. So, 3 is not a root.

Now, x=4:
\( f(4) = 4^5 + 3(4)^3 + (4)^2 + 2(4) \)
Calculating each term:

4^5: Let's compute step by step:
4^1=4
4^2=16 mod5=1
4^3=4*1=4
4^4=4*4=16 mod5=1
4^5=4*1=4 mod5=4

So, 4^5 mod5=4.

3*(4)^3: 4^3=64 mod5=4, so 3*4=12 mod5=2.

(4)^2=16 mod5=1.

2*4=8 mod5=3.

Adding them up: 4 +2 +1 +3=10 mod5=0.

Oh, that's zero! So, 4 is a root.

So, so far, I have x=0 and x=4 as zeros. Are there any more?

Wait, the polynomial is degree 5, so it can have up to 5 roots, but in a field, the number of roots is at most equal to the degree, but in finite fields, it's possible to have fewer. Since we have two roots, maybe there are more. But I only tested x=0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), those are all the elements.

Wait, but hold on, maybe I made a mistake in calculating f(1). Let me double-check f(1):

f(1)=1 + 3 +1 +2=7≡2 mod5≠0. Correct.

f(2)=2 +4 +4 +4=14≡4 mod5≠0.

f(3)=3 +1 +4 +1=9≡4 mod5≠0.

f(4)=4 +2 +1 +3=10≡0 mod5.

f(0)=0. So only 0 and 4 are roots.

Wait, but the polynomial is degree 5. So, in a field, the number of roots is at most 5, but it's possible to have less. Since it's a polynomial of degree 5, but in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), maybe it factors into lower degree polynomials.

Let me try to factor the polynomial.

Given that x=0 and x=4 are roots, so (x) and (x -4) are factors.

So, let's perform polynomial division to factor out x and (x -4).

First, let's factor out x. The polynomial is x^5 +3x^3 +x^2 +2x.

So, factor out x: x(x^4 +3x^2 +x +2).

Now, we have to factor x^4 +3x^2 +x +2.

We know that x=4 is a root, so let's perform polynomial division of x^4 +3x^2 +x +2 by (x -4).

Alternatively, since 4 ≡ -1 mod5, so (x -4) is equivalent to (x +1).

So, let's factor (x +1) out of x^4 +3x^2 +x +2.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Using synthetic division for x=-1:

Set up coefficients: 1 (x^4), 0 (x^3), 3 (x^2), 1 (x), 2 (constant).

Bring down the 1.

Multiply by -1: 1*(-1)=-1≡4 mod5.

Add to next coefficient: 0 +4=4.

Multiply by -1: 4*(-1)= -4≡1 mod5.

Add to next coefficient:3 +1=4.

Multiply by -1:4*(-1)= -4≡1 mod5.

Add to next coefficient:1 +1=2.

Multiply by -1:2*(-1)= -2≡3 mod5.

Add to last coefficient:2 +3=5≡0 mod5.

So, the result is 1 4 4 2, which corresponds to x^3 +4x^2 +4x +2.

So, now, the polynomial factors as x(x +1)(x^3 +4x^2 +4x +2).

Now, let's factor the cubic polynomial x^3 +4x^2 +4x +2.

Let me check for roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). Let's test x=0: 0 +0 +0 +2=2≠0.

x=1:1 +4 +4 +2=11≡1≠0.

x=2:8 +16 +8 +2=34≡4≠0.

x=3:27 +36 +12 +2=77≡77-15*5=77-75=2≠0.

x=4:64 +64 +16 +2=146≡146-29*5=146-145=1≠0.

So, the cubic has no roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). Therefore, it's irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). So, the only roots are x=0 and x=4.

Thus, the zeros are 0 and 4.

Looking back at the options, D is 0,4. So, the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other roots. I tested all elements, and only 0 and 4 worked. The cubic doesn't factor further, so yes, only two roots.

So, the answer is D: 0,4.
</think>

D","<think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all the zeros of the polynomial \(x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x\) in the finite field \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). Hmm, finite fields, also known as Galois fields, right? Specifically, \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) has elements 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since it's a finite field with 5 elements, every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.

The polynomial is of degree 5, so there should be at most 5 zeros in the field, but since it's over a finite field, it might have fewer. Let me try plugging in each element of \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) into the polynomial and see if it equals zero.

First, let's list the elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

I'll start with x=0:
\( f(0) = 0^5 + 3(0)^3 + (0)^2 + 2(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \)
So, 0 is a zero. That's one zero found.

Next, x=1:
\( f(1) = 1^5 + 3(1)^3 + (1)^2 + 2(1) = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7 \)
But in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), 7 mod 5 is 2. So, 2 ≠ 0. Therefore, 1 is not a zero.

Wait, that seems off. Let me recalculate:
\(1^5 = 1\)
\(3(1)^3 = 3\)
\(1^2 = 1\)
\(2(1) = 2\)
Adding them up: 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7. Yes, 7 mod 5 is 2. So, 1 is not a root.

Moving on to x=2:
\( f(2) = 2^5 + 3(2)^3 + (2)^2 + 2(2) \)
Calculating each term:
\(2^5 = 32\), but in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), 32 mod 5 is 2 (since 5*6=30, 32-30=2)
\(3(2)^3 = 3*8 = 24\), which mod 5 is 4 (since 24 - 5*4=24-20=4)
\(2^2 = 4\)
\(2*2 = 4\)
Adding them up: 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14
14 mod 5 is 4, since 5*2=10, 14-10=4. So, 4 ≠ 0. 2 is not a zero.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake in calculating 2^5. Let me double-check:
2^1 = 2
2^2 = 4
2^3 = 8 mod 5 is 3
2^4 = 16 mod 5 is 1
2^5 = 32 mod 5 is 2. Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, 2^3 is 8 mod 5 is 3. So 3*3=9 mod5 is 4. So that's correct.

So f(2)=2 +4 +4 +4=14 mod5=4≠0. So, 2 is not a root.

Next, x=3:
\( f(3) = 3^5 + 3(3)^3 + (3)^2 + 2(3) \)
Calculating each term:
3^5: Let's compute step by step:
3^1=3
3^2=9 mod5=4
3^3=12 mod5=2
3^4=6 mod5=1
3^5=3 mod5=3
So, 3^5 mod5=3.

3(3)^3: 3^3=27 mod5=2, so 3*2=6 mod5=1.

(3)^2=9 mod5=4.

2*3=6 mod5=1.

Adding them up: 3 +1 +4 +1=9 mod5=4≠0. So, 3 is not a root.

Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me verify each term again.

3^5: 3^1=3, 3^2=9≡4, 3^3=12≡2, 3^4=6≡1, 3^5=3. Yes, that's correct.

3*(3)^3: 3^3=27≡2, so 3*2=6≡1. Correct.

3^2=9≡4. Correct.

2*3=6≡1. Correct.

Total: 3 +1 +4 +1=9≡4. So, 4≠0. So, 3 is not a root.

Now, x=4:
\( f(4) = 4^5 + 3(4)^3 + (4)^2 + 2(4) \)
Calculating each term:

4^5: Let's compute step by step:
4^1=4
4^2=16 mod5=1
4^3=4*1=4
4^4=4*4=16 mod5=1
4^5=4*1=4 mod5=4

So, 4^5 mod5=4.

3*(4)^3: 4^3=64 mod5=4, so 3*4=12 mod5=2.

(4)^2=16 mod5=1.

2*4=8 mod5=3.

Adding them up: 4 +2 +1 +3=10 mod5=0.

Oh, that's zero! So, 4 is a root.

So, so far, I have x=0 and x=4 as zeros. Are there any more?

Wait, the polynomial is degree 5, so it can have up to 5 roots, but in a field, the number of roots is at most equal to the degree, but in finite fields, it's possible to have fewer. Since we have two roots, maybe there are more. But I only tested x=0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), those are all the elements.

f(1)=1 + 3 +1 +2=7≡2 mod5≠0. Correct.

f(2)=2 +4 +4 +4=14≡4 mod5≠0.

f(3)=3 +1 +4 +1=9≡4 mod5≠0.

f(4)=4 +2 +1 +3=10≡0 mod5.

f(0)=0. So only 0 and 4 are roots.

Wait, but the polynomial is degree 5. So, in a field, the number of roots is at most 5, but it's possible to have less. Since it's a polynomial of degree 5, but in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), maybe it factors into lower degree polynomials.

Let me try to factor the polynomial.

Given that x=0 and x=4 are roots, so (x) and (x -4) are factors.

So, let's perform polynomial division to factor out x and (x -4).

First, let's factor out x. The polynomial is x^5 +3x^3 +x^2 +2x.

So, factor out x: x(x^4 +3x^2 +x +2).

Now, we have to factor x^4 +3x^2 +x +2.

We know that x=4 is a root, so let's perform polynomial division of x^4 +3x^2 +x +2 by (x -4).

Alternatively, since 4 ≡ -1 mod5, so (x -4) is equivalent to (x +1).

So, let's factor (x +1) out of x^4 +3x^2 +x +2.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Using synthetic division for x=-1:

Set up coefficients: 1 (x^4), 0 (x^3), 3 (x^2), 1 (x), 2 (constant).

Bring down the 1.

Multiply by -1: 1*(-1)=-1≡4 mod5.

Add to next coefficient: 0 +4=4.

Multiply by -1: 4*(-1)= -4≡1 mod5.

Add to next coefficient:3 +1=4.

Multiply by -1:4*(-1)= -4≡1 mod5.

Add to next coefficient:1 +1=2.

Multiply by -1:2*(-1)= -2≡3 mod5.

Add to last coefficient:2 +3=5≡0 mod5.

So, the result is 1 4 4 2, which corresponds to x^3 +4x^2 +4x +2.

So, now, the polynomial factors as x(x +1)(x^3 +4x^2 +4x +2).

Now, let's factor the cubic polynomial x^3 +4x^2 +4x +2.

Let me check for roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). Let's test x=0: 0 +0 +0 +2=2≠0.

x=1:1 +4 +4 +2=11≡1≠0.

x=2:8 +16 +8 +2=34≡4≠0.

x=3:27 +36 +12 +2=77≡77-15*5=77-75=2≠0.

x=4:64 +64 +16 +2=146≡146-29*5=146-145=1≠0.

So, the cubic has no roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). Therefore, it's irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). So, the only roots are x=0 and x=4.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two statements about group theory are true or false. Let me take it step by step.

First, let's look at Statement 1: ""A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian."" Hmm, okay. I remember that a factor group, or quotient group, is formed by partitioning a group into cosets of a normal subgroup. Now, the original group here is non-Abelian, which means it doesn't satisfy the commutative property for all its elements. But does that necessarily make its factor group non-Abelian?

I think about what makes a group Abelian. If every pair of elements commutes, the group is Abelian. But in a non-Abelian group, there are at least some elements that don't commute. However, when you form a factor group, you're essentially looking at the group modulo a normal subgroup. The operations in the factor group are defined in terms of the original group's operations, but restricted to the cosets.

So, is the factor group non-Abelian? I recall that the factor group's operation is defined by multiplying representatives of the cosets. If the original group is non-Abelian, does that carry over to the factor group? Or is it possible for the factor group to be Abelian even if the original group isn't?

Wait, let me think of an example. Take the symmetric group S3, which is non-Abelian. Its normal subgroup is A3, the alternating group. The factor group S3/A3 is isomorphic to C2, which is cyclic and hence Abelian. So in this case, the factor group is Abelian, even though the original group wasn't. That means Statement 1 is false.

Okay, so Statement 1 is false. Now, moving on to Statement 2: ""If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G."" 

This seems a bit tricky. Let me break it down. K is normal in H, so H is a normal subgroup of K, and H is normal in G. Does that make K normal in G?

I think about the properties of normal subgroups. If K is normal in H and H is normal in G, does that imply K is normal in G? I don't think so. Normality isn't transitive in that way. For example, consider G = S3, H = A3, and K = {e, (123)}. Here, K is normal in H because H is Abelian, but H is normal in G because S3 is non-Abelian and H is its normal subgroup. However, is K normal in G? Let me check.

In S3, the subgroup K = {e, (123)} is normal in A3, but in S3, does K have a unique inverse in S3? Let's see. The inverse of (123) is (123), which is in K, so maybe K is normal in S3 as well. Hmm, maybe my example isn't the best.

Wait, perhaps I should think of a different example. Let G be S4, H be A4, and K be a subgroup of A4 that's normal in A4, say the Klein four-group V4. Since H is normal in G, but K is not necessarily normal in G. Actually, V4 is normal in A4, but is it normal in S4? Since S4 is not Abelian, and V4 is Klein, which is Abelian, but in S4, elements of V4 might not commute with some elements outside H. So V4 might not be normal in S4. Therefore, K isn't necessarily normal in G. 

So, Statement 2 is also false.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. In my first example with S3, H=A3, K={e, (123)}, K is normal in H and H is normal in G=S3. Is K normal in G? Let's see: in S3, the conjugate of K by any element of S3. Let's take the element (12), conjugating K. (12)(123)(12) = (132), which is not in K. So K is not normal in S3. Therefore, Statement 2 is false because K is not necessarily normal in G even if it's normal in H and H is normal in G.

So both statements are false. That would make the answer B: False, False.

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to multiply two polynomials in Z_8[x]. The polynomials given are f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2. Hmm, let me remember how polynomial multiplication works. I think it's similar to multiplying numbers, but with variables. Each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and then we combine like terms. But since we're working in Z_8, all the coefficients will be modulo 8. That might affect the final result, so I need to be careful with the arithmetic.

Let me write down the polynomials first:

f(x) = 4x - 5

g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2

I need to compute f(x) * g(x). So, let me distribute each term of f(x) across each term of g(x).

First, multiply 4x by each term in g(x):

4x * 2x^2 = 8x^3

4x * (-4x) = -16x^2

4x * 2 = 8x

Next, multiply -5 by each term in g(x):

-5 * 2x^2 = -10x^2

-5 * (-4x) = 20x

-5 * 2 = -10

Now, let me write down all these terms:

8x^3 -16x^2 + 8x -10x^2 + 20x -10

Now, I need to combine like terms. Let's group them by the power of x.

First, the x^3 term: 8x^3

Next, the x^2 terms: -16x^2 -10x^2. Let me compute that: -16 -10 = -26. But in Z_8, -26 mod 8 is... Well, 8*3=24, so 26 -24=2, so -26 mod 8 is -2, which is equal to 6 mod 8 (since -2 +8=6). So, -26x^2 is equivalent to 6x^2 in Z_8.

Then, the x terms: 8x + 20x. Let's compute 8 +20=28. 28 mod 8 is 4, because 8*3=24, 28-24=4. So, 28x is equivalent to 4x in Z_8.

Finally, the constant term: -10. Let's compute -10 mod 8. 8*1=8, so -10 +16=6. So, -10 is equivalent to 6 mod 8.

Putting it all together:

8x^3 +6x^2 +4x +6

But wait, in Z_8, coefficients are modulo 8. So, let me check each coefficient:

- 8x^3: 8 mod 8 is 0, so this term becomes 0.

- 6x^2: 6 mod 8 is 6.

- 4x: 4 mod 8 is 4.

- 6: 6 mod 8 is 6.

So, the terms with 0 coefficient can be omitted, so the result simplifies to:

6x^2 +4x +6

Looking at the options, that's option B: 6x^2 +4x +6.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake with the signs or the moduli.

Starting again, f(x)*g(x):

(4x -5)(2x^2 -4x +2) = 4x*2x^2 +4x*(-4x) +4x*2 -5*2x^2 -5*(-4x) -5*2

Which is 8x^3 -16x^2 +8x -10x^2 +20x -10

Combining like terms:

x^3: 8x^3

x^2: (-16 -10)x^2 = -26x^2

x: (8 +20)x =28x

Constants: -10

Now, in Z_8:

8x^3 mod8=0

-26x^2 mod8: Let's compute -26 mod8. 8*3=24, so 26-24=2, so -26 mod8= -2 mod8=6

28x mod8: 28/8=3*8=24, 28-24=4, so 28 mod8=4

-10 mod8: -10 +16=6

So, the result is 0 +6x^2 +4x +6, which is 6x^2 +4x +6. So, yes, option B.

I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my steps.

B","<think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to multiply two polynomials in Z_8[x]. The polynomials given are f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2. Hmm, let me remember how polynomial multiplication works. I think it's similar to multiplying numbers, but with variables. Each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and then we combine like terms. But since we're working in Z_8, all the coefficients will be modulo 8. That might affect the final result, so I need to be careful with the arithmetic.

Let me write down the polynomials first:

f(x) = 4x - 5

g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2

I need to compute f(x) * g(x). So, let me distribute each term of f(x) across each term of g(x).

First, multiply 4x by each term in g(x):

4x * 2x^2 = 8x^3

4x * (-4x) = -16x^2

4x * 2 = 8x

Next, multiply -5 by each term in g(x):

-5 * 2x^2 = -10x^2

-5 * (-4x) = 20x

-5 * 2 = -10

Now, let me write down all these terms:

8x^3 -16x^2 + 8x -10x^2 + 20x -10

Now, I need to combine like terms. Let's group them by the power of x.

First, the x^3 term: 8x^3

Next, the x^2 terms: -16x^2 -10x^2. Let me compute that: -16 -10 = -26. But in Z_8, -26 mod 8 is... Well, 8*3=24, so 26 -24=2, so -26 mod 8 is -2, which is equal to 6 mod 8 (since -2 +8=6). So, -26x^2 is equivalent to 6x^2 in Z_8.

Then, the x terms: 8x + 20x. Let's compute 8 +20=28. 28 mod 8 is 4, because 8*3=24, 28-24=4. So, 28x is equivalent to 4x in Z_8.

Finally, the constant term: -10. Let's compute -10 mod 8. 8*1=8, so -10 +16=6. So, -10 is equivalent to 6 mod 8.

Putting it all together:

8x^3 +6x^2 +4x +6

But wait, in Z_8, coefficients are modulo 8. So, let me check each coefficient:

- 8x^3: 8 mod 8 is 0, so this term becomes 0.

- 6x^2: 6 mod 8 is 6.

- 4x: 4 mod 8 is 4.

- 6: 6 mod 8 is 6.

So, the terms with 0 coefficient can be omitted, so the result simplifies to:

6x^2 +4x +6

Looking at the options, that's option B: 6x^2 +4x +6.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake with the signs or the moduli.

Starting again, f(x)*g(x):

(4x -5)(2x^2 -4x +2) = 4x*2x^2 +4x*(-4x) +4x*2 -5*2x^2 -5*(-4x) -5*2

Which is 8x^3 -16x^2 +8x -10x^2 +20x -10

Combining like terms:

x^3: 8x^3

x^2: (-16 -10)x^2 = -26x^2

x: (8 +20)x =28x

Constants: -10

Now, in Z_8:

8x^3 mod8=0

-26x^2 mod8: Let's compute -26 mod8. 8*3=24, so 26-24=2, so -26 mod8= -2 mod8=6

28x mod8: 28/8=3*8=24, 28-24=4, so 28 mod8=4

-10 mod8: -10 +16=6

So, the result is 0 +6x^2 +4x +6, which is 6x^2 +4x +6. So, yes, option B.
