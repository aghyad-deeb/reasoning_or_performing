Okay, so I need to figure out the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q. Hmm, let me start by recalling some concepts from field theory. The degree of a field extension is the dimension of the extension field as a vector space over the base field, which in this case is Q.

First, let me write down the field in question: Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)). I know that Q(sqrt(2)) is a field extension of Q with degree 2 because sqrt(2) is irrational and not expressible as a fraction of integers. Similarly, Q(sqrt(3)) is also a degree 2 extension over Q.

Now, sqrt(18) is interesting. Let me simplify that: sqrt(18) is sqrt(9*2) which is 3*sqrt(2). So sqrt(18) is just 3 times sqrt(2). That means sqrt(18) is already in Q(sqrt(2)) because 3 is a rational number. So including sqrt(18) into the field doesn't add any new elements beyond what's already in Q(sqrt(2)).

So, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is actually the same as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). That simplifies things because I can consider the extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q.

I know that when we adjoin sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) to Q, the degree of the extension is the product of the degrees of each individual extension, provided they are linearly disjoint. Let me verify if sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are linearly disjoint over Q. They are because sqrt(2) is not a rational multiple of sqrt(3), so their minimal polynomials are distinct and irreducible. Therefore, the extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) has degree 2 * 2 = 4 over Q.

Wait, but I should also make sure that the minimal polynomial of sqrt(18) is already accounted for. Since sqrt(18) is in Q(sqrt(2)), and we've included sqrt(2) in our field, we don't need to add anything extra for sqrt(18). So, the extension is indeed Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).

Therefore, the degree is 4. Let me double-check my reasoning. The minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) is x² - 2, which is irreducible over Q, and similarly, x² - 3 is irreducible over Q for sqrt(3). Since sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are not related by a rational multiple, their extensions are disjoint, so the total degree is multiplicative.

Yes, that seems correct. So the degree of the extension is 4.
