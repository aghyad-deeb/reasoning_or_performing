Okay, so I need to find all the zeros of the polynomial \( x^3 + 2x + 2 \) in the finite field \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \). Hmm, finite fields can be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle this. Let me recall that \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \) consists of the elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} with arithmetic operations done modulo 7. So, to find the zeros, I need to find all elements \( a \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \) such that when I substitute \( a \) into the polynomial, the result is 0 modulo 7.

Alright, let me write down the polynomial again: \( f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 2 \). I need to evaluate this polynomial for each element in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \) and see if it equals zero.

Starting with \( x = 0 \):
\( f(0) = 0^3 + 2*0 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 \mod 7 \). That's 2, which isn't zero, so 0 isn't a root.

Next, \( x = 1 \):
\( f(1) = 1^3 + 2*1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \mod 7 \). 5 isn't zero either.

Moving on to \( x = 2 \):
\( f(2) = 2^3 + 2*2 + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \mod 7 \). 14 divided by 7 is 2 with no remainder, so 14 mod 7 is 0. So, 2 is a root. That's one zero found.

Now, \( x = 3 \):
\( f(3) = 3^3 + 2*3 + 2 = 27 + 6 + 2 = 35 \mod 7 \). 35 divided by 7 is 5, so 35 mod 7 is 0. Therefore, 3 is another root.

Wait, so far I have 2 and 3 as roots. Let me check if there's a third root. Since it's a cubic polynomial, there should be three roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), considering that it might factor completely or have some multiple roots. But let me continue checking all elements just to be sure.

\( x = 4 \):
\( f(4) = 4^3 + 2*4 + 2 = 64 + 8 + 2 = 74 \mod 7 \). Let me compute 74 divided by 7: 7*10=70, so 74-70=4. So, 74 mod 7 is 4. Not zero.

\( x = 5 \):
\( f(5) = 5^3 + 2*5 + 2 = 125 + 10 + 2 = 137 \mod 7 \). Let's see, 7*19=133, so 137-133=4. 137 mod 7 is 4. Not zero.

\( x = 6 \):
\( f(6) = 6^3 + 2*6 + 2 = 216 + 12 + 2 = 230 \mod 7 \). Calculating 230 divided by 7: 7*32=224, so 230-224=6. Thus, 230 mod 7 is 6. Not zero.

Wait, so the only roots I found are 2 and 3. But the polynomial is of degree 3, so it should have exactly 3 roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \). Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations? Let me double-check \( x = 4 \):

\( f(4) = 4^3 + 2*4 + 2 = 64 + 8 + 2 \). 64 mod 7: 7*9=63, so 64-63=1. 8 mod 7 is 1, and 2 mod 7 is 2. So, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 mod 7. Correct, 4 isn't a root.

How about \( x = 5 \): 5^3 is 125, 125 mod 7: 7*17=119, so 125-119=6. 2*5=10 mod 7 is 3, and 2 mod 7 is 2. So, 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 mod 7 is 4. Still 4. Not zero.

And \( x = 6 \): 6^3 is 216, 216 mod 7: 7*30=210, so 216-210=6. 2*6=12 mod 7 is 5, and 2 mod 7 is 2. So, 6 + 5 + 2 = 13 mod 7 is 6. Correct, not zero.

Hmm, so only 2 and 3 are roots. But wait, let me factor the polynomial using these roots. If 2 and 3 are roots, then \( (x - 2)(x - 3) \) should be a factor. Let me perform polynomial division to factor it out.

Alternatively, since it's a cubic, maybe I can perform synthetic division to factor it.

Wait, another approach is to factor the polynomial. Let me write \( f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 2 \). If 2 is a root, then \( f(x) = (x - 2)(x^2 + ax + b) \). Let me perform the multiplication:

\( (x - 2)(x^2 + ax + b) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx - 2x^2 - 2ax - 2b \).

Combine like terms:

\( x^3 + (a - 2)x^2 + (b - 2a)x - 2b \).

Set this equal to \( x^3 + 0x^2 + 2x + 2 \). So, equate coefficients:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): 1 = 1. Okay.
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( a - 2 = 0 \) => \( a = 2 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( b - 2a = 2 \). Since \( a = 2 \), this becomes \( b - 4 = 2 \) => \( b = 6 \).
4. Constant term: \( -2b = 2 \). So, \( -2b = 2 \) => \( b = -1 \mod 7 \). Since \( -1 \mod 7 \) is 6, which matches the previous result.

So, the polynomial factors as \( (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 6) \). Now, let's check the quadratic factor \( x^2 + 2x + 6 \). Maybe it has another root in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \).

Let me evaluate the quadratic at each element:

- At x=0: 0 + 0 + 6 = 6 ≠ 0
- x=1: 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 ≡ 2 ≠ 0
- x=2: 4 + 4 + 6 = 14 ≡ 0. Oh, so 2 is a root again. Wait, but we already knew 2 is a root. Hmm.

Wait, no, the quadratic is \( x^2 + 2x + 6 \). If x=2 is a root, then it should factor as \( (x - 2)(x - c) \). Let me check:

If 2 is a root, then \( (x - 2)(x - c) = x^2 - (2 + c)x + 2c \). Comparing to \( x^2 + 2x + 6 \):

- Coefficient of x: \( -(2 + c) = 2 \) => \( 2 + c = -2 \mod 7 \) => \( c = -4 \mod 7 \) => c=3.

Constant term: \( 2c = 6 \) => \( c = 3 \). So yes, it factors as \( (x - 2)(x - 3) \). Wait, but that means the quadratic has roots 2 and 3. But we already had 2 and 3 as roots of the cubic. So, does that mean the cubic has a double root at 2 and a single root at 3?

But wait, when I evaluated the cubic at x=2, it was zero, and at x=3, it was zero. But when I factored it, I had \( (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 6) \), and then factoring the quadratic, I got another (x - 2). So, does that mean the cubic is \( (x - 2)^2(x - 3) \)?

Let me check: \( (x - 2)^2(x - 3) = (x^2 - 4x + 4)(x - 3) \). Multiply it out:

First, multiply \( x^2 \) by \( x - 3 \): \( x^3 - 3x^2 \).

Then, multiply \( -4x \) by \( x - 3 \): \( -4x^2 + 12x \).

Then, multiply 4 by \( x - 3 \): \( 4x - 12 \).

Combine all terms:

\( x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x^2 + 12x + 4x - 12 \).

Combine like terms:

\( x^3 - 7x^2 + 16x - 12 \).

Now, modulo 7:

- \( -7x^2 \mod 7 = 0 \)
- \( 16x \mod 7 = 2x \)
- \( -12 \mod 7 = 2 \)

So, modulo 7, it becomes \( x^3 + 0x^2 + 2x + 2 \), which is exactly our original polynomial. So, yes, the polynomial factors as \( (x - 2)^2(x - 3) \). Therefore, the roots are 2 (with multiplicity 2) and 3.

But wait, earlier when I evaluated the polynomial at x=2, it was 0, and at x=3, it was 0. So, both 2 and 3 are roots, and since 2 is a double root, that's why the polynomial has exactly three roots, counting multiplicity.

So, the zeros in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \) are 2 and 3. Wait, but 2 is a double root, but in the finite field, do we consider multiplicity? Or do we just list all distinct roots?

I think in the context of finite fields, when we talk about zeros of a polynomial, we usually list all distinct roots. So, even though 2 is a double root, we still list it once. So, the zeros are 2 and 3.

Looking back at the options:

A. 1

B. 2

C. 2,3

D. 6

So, the correct answer should be option C: 2,3.

Wait, but let me double-check the factoring again because it's important. The polynomial is \( x^3 + 2x + 2 \). Factoring out (x - 2), we get \( (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 6) \). Then, factoring \( x^2 + 2x + 6 \), we get another (x - 2), so \( (x - 2)^2(x - 3) \). Plugging in x=2 and x=3, we get zero. Therefore, the roots are 2 and 3.

Alternatively, if I didn't factor it, I could have noticed that since 2 is a root, I can perform polynomial division to reduce the cubic to a quadratic, then find the roots of the quadratic. Let me try that as another method.

Dividing \( x^3 + 2x + 2 \) by (x - 2) using polynomial long division in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \):

Divide x^3 by x: x^2. Multiply (x - 2) by x^2: x^3 - 2x^2.

Subtract from the original polynomial:

\( (x^3 + 0x^2 + 2x + 2) - (x^3 - 2x^2) = 2x^2 + 2x + 2 \).

Now, divide 2x^2 by x: 2x. Multiply (x - 2) by 2x: 2x^2 - 4x.

Subtract:

\( (2x^2 + 2x + 2) - (2x^2 - 4x) = 6x + 2 \).

Now, divide 6x by x: 6. Multiply (x - 2) by 6: 6x - 12.

Subtract:

\( (6x + 2) - (6x - 12) = 14 \mod 7 = 0 \).

So, the division is exact, and the quotient is \( x^2 + 2x + 6 \). So, \( f(x) = (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 6) \). Now, we can factor the quadratic:

Looking for two numbers a and b in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \) such that \( a + b = 2 \) and \( ab = 6 \). Wait, but in the quadratic \( x^2 + 2x + 6 \), the coefficients are 2 and 6. Let me see if I can factor it.

Alternatively, use the quadratic formula in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \). The roots are given by \( x = [-2 \pm \sqrt{(2)^2 - 4*1*6}] / 2 \mod 7 \).

Compute discriminant: \( 4 - 24 = -20 \mod 7 \). -20 mod 7: 7*3=21, so -20 +21=1. So, discriminant is 1.

So, sqrt(1) in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \) is 1 and 6 (since 6^2=36≡1 mod7).

Thus, roots are \( (-2 ±1)/2 \mod 7 \).

First root: (-2 +1)/2 = (-1)/2 mod7. What is -1/2 mod7? 2^{-1} mod7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1. So, (-1)/2 = (-1)*4= -4 ≡3 mod7.

Second root: (-2 -1)/2 = (-3)/2 mod7. Similarly, (-3)/2 = (-3)*4= -12≡-12+14=2 mod7.

So, the roots of the quadratic are 3 and 2. Therefore, the quadratic factors as (x - 3)(x - 2), confirming our earlier factorization. So, the cubic polynomial factors as (x - 2)^2(x - 3), with roots at 2 (twice) and 3.

Therefore, the zeros are 2 and 3. So, the correct option is C: 2,3.

I think I've double-checked everything. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, yeah, the answer should be C.
