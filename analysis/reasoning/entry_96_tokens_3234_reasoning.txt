Alright, so I have this question about group theory, and I need to figure out whether two statements are true or false. Let me start by recalling some basic group theory concepts because I'm a bit rusty, but I think I can work through this.

First, the question presents two statements about subgroups and cosets. Let's take them one at a time.

**Statement 1:** If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G, then aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a is in H.

Hmm, okay. So H is a subgroup of G, and we're looking at the left coset aH. The statement is saying that aH is a subgroup of G exactly when a is in H. I remember that for a coset to be a subgroup, it has to satisfy the subgroup criteria. So, for aH to be a subgroup, it needs to contain the identity element, be closed under the group operation, and contain inverses.

Let me think. If a is in H, then aH is a coset, and since H is a subgroup, aH should also be a subgroup. That makes sense because if a is in H, then aH is just H shifted by a, so all the elements of H are in aH, and since H is a subgroup, so is aH. So, the forward direction seems true: if a is in H, then aH is a subgroup.

Now, the converse: if aH is a subgroup of G, then a must be in H. Suppose aH is a subgroup. Then, since H is a subgroup, H must contain the inverse of a, which is a^{-1}. So, a^{-1}H is also a subgroup. If aH is a subgroup, then a^{-1}H must be equal to aH because they're both subgroups of G. So, a^{-1}H = aH, which implies that a is in H because otherwise, the two cosets would be distinct. So, the converse is also true. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

**Statement 2:** If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.

Alright, this one is a bit trickier. Let me parse it. It's saying that the cosets aH and bH are equal if and only if the product ab is in H. Let's break this into two directions.

First, suppose aH = bH. What does that tell us about ab? Since aH = bH, then b is in aH because H is a subgroup, so b = a h for some h in H. Similarly, a is in bH because a = b k for some k in H. So, multiplying these two, a = b k and b = a h, so substituting, a = (a h) k = a (h k). Since H is a subgroup, h k is in H, so a = a h'' where h'' is in H. Therefore, a(a^{-1}) = a(h'' a^{-1}), which implies that a^{-1} is in H because h'' a^{-1} is in H and a is in G. So, a^{-1} is in H, which means that a is in H (since H is a subgroup, inverses are also in H). Therefore, if aH = bH, then ab = a(b) = (a)(b) = a (a^{-1} a b) = (a a^{-1}) a b = e a b = ab. Wait, that seems off. Let me try another approach.

If aH = bH, then for any h in H, a h = b h. So, a h = b h implies that a = b h h^{-1} for some h in H. So, a is equal to b conjugated by h, which means that a is in the conjugacy class of b. But does that imply that ab is in H? Let me test with an example.

Suppose G is the symmetric group S3, H is the subgroup A3 (the alternating group), and let a and b be two elements of A3. Then, aH = bH because they are both in A3, and A3 is a normal subgroup of S3. Now, ab is also in A3, so ab is in H. So, in this case, it works.

But let's consider another group where H might not be normal. Suppose G is S3, and H is a subgroup that's not normal, say H is a cyclic subgroup of order 3. Let a be an element of H, say a=(1 2 3), and let b be another element not in H, say b=(1 2). Then, aH is the cyclic subgroup generated by a, and bH is the cyclic subgroup generated by b. These are different cosets. So, aH ≠ bH, and indeed, ab is not in H because ab is (1 2 3)(1 2) = (1 3), which is in H? Wait, no, H is the cyclic subgroup generated by a, which is {e, a, a^2}, and ab is (1 3), which is not in H because H only has (1 2 3), (1 3 2), and e. So ab is not in H, and indeed, aH ≠ bH. So, in this case, it works as well.

Wait, maybe I'm not choosing the right example. Let me think again. Suppose H is a subgroup of G, and aH = bH. Then, a = b h for some h in H. So, a = b h, and since h is in H, then ab = a b = (b h) b = b (h b). Since H is a subgroup, h b is in H, so ab is in b H, but ab is also in a H because a H = b H. So, ab is in H. Therefore, the forward direction seems to hold: if aH = bH, then ab is in H.

Now, for the converse: if ab is in H, does that imply aH = bH? Suppose ab is in H. Then, since H is a subgroup, b^{-1}ab is in H. But b^{-1}ab is in H, which is a subgroup, so a is in b H. Similarly, since H is a subgroup, a^{-1} is in H, so b is in a H. Therefore, a is in b H and b is in a H, which implies that a H = b H. So, the converse also holds. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me test with an example where H is not normal. Suppose G is S3, H is the subgroup generated by (1 2), which is cyclic of order 2, and let a=(1 2 3) and b=(1 3 2). Then, ab = (1 2 3)(1 3 2) = (1 2). Since H is generated by (1 2), ab is in H. Now, is aH = bH? Let's see. aH is the cyclic subgroup generated by a, which is {e, a, a^2}, and bH is the cyclic subgroup generated by b, which is {e, b, b^2}. Since a and b are in different conjugacy classes (a is a 3-cycle, b is another 3-cycle), their subgroups are distinct. So, aH ≠ bH, but ab is in H. So, this contradicts the statement that aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.

Wait, but in this case, ab is in H, but aH ≠ bH. So, the converse fails. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested that if ab is in H, then aH = bH. But in this example, ab is in H, but aH ≠ bH. So, the converse is not true. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but let me check the example again. H is generated by (1 2), which is {e, (1 2)}. a=(1 2 3), b=(1 3 2). ab = (1 2 3)(1 3 2) = (1 2). So, ab is in H. Now, aH is the cyclic subgroup generated by a, which is {e, (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}. Similarly, bH is {e, (1 3 2), (1 2 3)}. So, actually, aH and bH are the same as H? Wait, no, H is {e, (1 2)}, which is different from aH and bH.

Wait, I think I confused H with aH and bH. Let me clarify. H is the subgroup generated by (1 2), so H = {e, (1 2)}. aH is the cyclic subgroup generated by a=(1 2 3), which is {e, a, a^2} = {e, (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}. Similarly, bH is the cyclic subgroup generated by b=(1 3 2), which is the same as aH. So, in this case, aH = bH, even though H is different.

Wait, that's confusing. H is {e, (1 2)}, but aH and bH are both {e, a, a^2}, which are different from H. So, in this case, ab is in H, but aH is not equal to bH because aH and bH are both equal to each other but different from H. So, the statement is about aH = bH, which in this case is true, but H is a different subgroup. Wait, no, the statement is about aH = bH if and only if ab is in H. So, in this case, ab is in H, and aH = bH, so the statement holds.

But earlier, I thought of another example where H is a subgroup not containing ab, but in that case, aH ≠ bH. Wait, maybe I need a different example.

Let me try G = S3 again. Let H be the subgroup generated by (1 2 3), so H = {e, (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}. Let a = (1 2), which is not in H, and b = (1 3). Then, ab = (1 2)(1 3) = (1 3 2), which is in H. Now, aH is the cyclic subgroup generated by a=(1 2), which is {e, (1 2)}. Similarly, bH is the cyclic subgroup generated by b=(1 3), which is {e, (1 3)}. So, aH and bH are different, and ab is in H. Therefore, in this case, aH ≠ bH, but ab is in H. So, this contradicts the statement that aH = bH iff ab is in H. Therefore, the statement is false.

Yes, that makes sense. So, Statement 2 is false because there exist cases where ab is in H but aH ≠ bH.

Wait, but in the first example, when H is generated by (1 2), and a and b are 3-cycles, ab is in H, and aH = bH. So, in that case, the statement holds. But in the second example, when a and b are transpositions not in H, ab is in H, but aH ≠ bH. Therefore, the statement is not always true, so it's false.

So, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. Therefore, the answer should be C: True, False.

Wait, but earlier I thought Statement 2 was true, but then I found a counterexample where it's false. So, I need to make sure.

Yes, the key is that if aH = bH, then ab is in H, which is true because aH = bH implies a = b h for some h in H, so ab = a b = (b h) b = b (h b). Since h b is in H, ab is in H. Conversely, if ab is in H, then a is in bH because ab = b (a b^{-1}), since b^{-1}ab is in H. So, a is in bH, and b is in aH, so aH = bH. Wait, but in my second example, ab was in H, but aH ≠ bH. So, what's the issue here?

Wait, no, in my second example, ab was in H, and aH = bH because both aH and bH were equal to {e, a, a^2} and {e, b, b^2}, which are actually the same because a and b are conjugate. Wait, no, in S3, a=(1 2) and b=(1 3). Are they conjugate? Let me check. Conjugation in S3 sends (1 2) to (1 3), so yes, they are conjugate. Therefore, aH = bH because they generate the same cyclic subgroup. So, in that case, aH = bH. But wait, earlier I thought aH and bH were different, but actually, they're the same because a and b are conjugate, so they generate the same subgroup.

Wait, so in that example, ab is in H, and aH = bH. So, that example doesn't contradict the statement. Then, where is the counterexample?

Let me think of another group where a and b are not conjugate, but ab is in H. Let's take G = D4, the dihedral group of order 8. Let H be the subgroup generated by a rotation of 180 degrees, say r^2, so H = {e, r^2}. Let a = r, which is a rotation of 90 degrees, and b = r^3, a rotation of 270 degrees. Then, ab = r * r^3 = r^4 = r^4 = r^{-2}, which is in H because H contains r^2. Now, aH is the cyclic subgroup generated by r, which is {e, r, r^2, r^3}, and bH is the cyclic subgroup generated by r^3, which is {e, r^3, r^6, r^7}. So, aH ≠ bH, but ab is in H. Therefore, this is a counterexample where ab is in H, but aH ≠ bH. So, Statement 2 is false.

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. So, the answer is C.
