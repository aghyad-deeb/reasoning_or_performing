Okay, so I have this polynomial \( x^4 + 4 \) and I need to factor it into linear factors in \( \mathbb{Z}_5[x] \). Hmm, factoring polynomials over finite fields can be tricky, but let me see how I can approach this.

First, I remember that in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), the field has elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, and arithmetic is done modulo 5. So, I need to find roots of the polynomial \( x^4 + 4 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). If I can find all roots, then I can factor the polynomial as the product of linear factors corresponding to those roots.

Let me try plugging in each element of \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) into the polynomial to see if it equals zero.

Starting with \( x = 0 \):
\( 0^4 + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4 \mod 5 \). That's not zero, so 0 is not a root.

Next, \( x = 1 \):
\( 1^4 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 \mod 5 = 0 \). Okay, so 1 is a root.

Then, \( x = 2 \):
\( 2^4 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20 \mod 5 = 0 \). So, 2 is also a root.

Now, \( x = 3 \):
\( 3^4 + 4 = 81 + 4 = 85 \mod 5 = 0 \). Wait, 85 divided by 5 is 17, so 85 mod 5 is 0. So, 3 is a root.

Wait, hold on. Let me check that calculation again. \( 3^4 \) is \( 81 \), right? And 81 divided by 5 is 16 with a remainder of 1. So, \( 81 \mod 5 = 1 \). Then, 1 + 4 = 5, which mod 5 is 0. So, yes, 3 is a root.

Wait another second, that can't be right because if 1, 2, and 3 are all roots, then the polynomial would have three linear factors, but it's a quartic, so it should have four roots. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate \( x = 3 \). \( 3^4 = 81 \). 81 divided by 5 is 16*5=80, so 81 mod 5 is 1. Then, 1 + 4 = 5, which mod 5 is 0. So, yes, 3 is a root.

Wait, that would mean the polynomial has four roots? But in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), a quartic polynomial can have at most 4 roots, right? So, if 1, 2, 3 are roots, maybe 4 is also a root? Let me check.

Testing \( x = 4 \):
\( 4^4 + 4 = 256 + 4 = 260 \mod 5 \). 260 divided by 5 is 52, so 260 mod 5 is 0. So, 4 is also a root.

Wait, that's four roots: 1, 2, 3, 4. So, that would mean the polynomial factors as \( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) \). But wait, none of the options given include all four roots. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A. (x − 2)(x + 2)(x − 1)(x + 1)
B. (x+1)^4
C. (x-1)(x+1)^3
D. (x-1)^3(x+1)

Hmm, none of these options have all four roots. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, \( x^4 + 4 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). Let me compute each value again:

For \( x = 0 \):
\( 0^4 + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4 \mod 5 \neq 0 \).

\( x = 1 \):
\( 1 + 4 = 5 \mod 5 = 0 \). Root.

\( x = 2 \):
\( 16 + 4 = 20 \mod 5 = 0 \). Root.

\( x = 3 \):
\( 81 + 4 = 85 \mod 5 = 0 \). Root.

\( x = 4 \):
\( 256 + 4 = 260 \mod 5 = 0 \). Root.

So, indeed, all elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) except 0 are roots. But that can't be because \( x^4 + 4 \) is a quartic, so it should have four roots. But in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), there are 5 elements, so maybe I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute \( x^4 + 4 \) modulo 5 correctly. Let me compute each \( x^4 \) modulo 5 first:

- \( 0^4 = 0 \)
- \( 1^4 = 1 \)
- \( 2^4 = 16 \mod 5 = 1 \)
- \( 3^4 = 81 \mod 5 = 1 \)
- \( 4^4 = 256 \mod 5 = 1 \)

So, \( x^4 \) modulo 5 is 0 for x=0 and 1 for x=1,2,3,4. Then, \( x^4 + 4 \) modulo 5 is:

- For x=0: 0 + 4 = 4 mod5
- For x=1: 1 + 4 = 5 mod5=0
- For x=2: 1 + 4 =5 mod5=0
- For x=3:1 +4=5 mod5=0
- For x=4:1+4=5 mod5=0

So, x=1,2,3,4 are all roots. That means the polynomial factors as (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5[x] \). But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says "factored into linear factors in \( \mathbb{Z}_5[x] \)". So, perhaps I should check if the polynomial can be factored differently, maybe not into linear factors but into quadratic or higher factors first, and then into linear.

Wait, but the question says linear factors, so it must factor into four linear factors. So, perhaps I'm wrong in my initial assumption that all four are roots. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating \( x^4 +4 \) for x=3 and x=4. Let me compute \( 3^4 +4 \) again: 81 +4=85, which is 17*5, so 85 mod5=0. Similarly, 4^4=256, which is 51*5=255, so 256 mod5=1. 1+4=5 mod5=0. So, yes, x=4 is a root.

Wait, but in that case, all non-zero elements are roots. So, the polynomial would split completely into linear factors as (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4). But that's not one of the options given. So, perhaps the question is incorrect or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let me check the polynomial again. It's \( x^4 +4 \). In \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), 4 is equivalent to -1. So, \( x^4 -1 \) would factor as (x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), because 1 and -1 are roots, and 2 and -2 (which is 3) are roots. Wait, but in our case, the polynomial is \( x^4 +4 = x^4 -1 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) because 4 ≡ -1 mod5. So, yes, it's \( x^4 -1 \).

Wait, so \( x^4 -1 \) factors as (x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). So, that would be (x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2). Let me check that.

Indeed, because \( x^4 -1 = (x^2 -1)(x^2 +1) = (x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2) \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). So, that's correct.

But looking at the options, option A is (x−2)(x+2)(x−1)(x+1), which is the same as what I just wrote. So, the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that all x=1,2,3,4 are roots, but that's because I was considering \( x^4 +4 \) as \( x^4 -1 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). So, yes, that's correct.

So, the factorization is (x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2), which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

A. (x − 2)(x + 2)(x − 1)(x + 1)
B. (x+1)^4
C. (x-1)(x+1)^3
D. (x-1)^3(x+1)

Yes, option A matches the factorization I found. So, the answer should be A.

But earlier I thought that all x=1,2,3,4 are roots, but perhaps that's a different polynomial. Wait, no, \( x^4 +4 = x^4 -1 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), so it's equivalent to \( x^4 -1 \), which factors as (x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2).

Wait, but in my initial testing, I found that x=1,2,3,4 are all roots, which would mean the polynomial splits into linear factors as (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4). But that's not the case because \( x^4 -1 \) factors into (x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2), which is option A.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

In \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), \( x^4 +4 = x^4 -1 \) because 4 ≡ -1 mod5. So, \( x^4 -1 \) factors as (x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2). So, the roots are x=1, x=-1=4, x=2, and x=-2=3. So, the factorization is (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4). But that's not what option A says. Option A says (x−2)(x+2)(x−1)(x+1), which is (x-2)(x-3)(x-1)(x+1). Wait, no, that's (x-2)(x+2)(x-1)(x+1), which is (x-2)(x-3)(x-1)(x+1). Wait, no, x+1 is x-4, because 1 +1=2, but wait, in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), 1+1=2, 2+1=3, 3+1=4, 4+1=0. So, x+1 is equivalent to x-4.

Wait, perhaps I should write all factors in terms of positive constants:

(x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2) = (x-1)(x-4)(x-2)(x-3). So, the factors are (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4). So, the factorization is into linear factors as (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4). But none of the options present this. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the polynomial.

Wait, maybe the polynomial is \( x^4 + 4 \) as is, not \( x^4 -1 \). Let me compute \( x^4 +4 \) modulo5 for x=0,1,2,3,4.

x=0: 0 +4=4≠0
x=1:1+4=5≡0
x=2:16+4=20≡0
x=3:81+4=85≡0
x=4:256+4=260≡0

So, all non-zero x are roots. So, the polynomial has four roots: 1,2,3,4. Therefore, it factors as (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4).

But again, that's not among the options. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the polynomial.

Wait, maybe the polynomial is \( x^4 +4x \) or something else, but the question says \( x^4 +4 \). So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the polynomial is \( x^4 +4x^2 \) or similar, but no, the question says \( x^4 +4 \). Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the polynomial can be factored into quadratics first, and then into linear factors.

Wait, in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), \( x^4 +4 \) can be written as \( x^4 -1 \), so it's a difference of squares: \( (x^2)^2 -1^2 = (x^2 -1)(x^2 +1) \). Then, each quadratic can be factored further.

In \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), \( x^2 -1 = (x-1)(x+1) \) and \( x^2 +1 = (x-2)(x+2) \). So, the complete factorization is (x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2), which is option A. So, that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought all x=1,2,3,4 are roots, but that's only if the polynomial is \( x^4 +4 \), which is \( x^4 -1 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). So, perhaps I confused the polynomial earlier.

So, the correct factorization is (x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2), which is option A. So, the answer is A.

But let me just confirm by expanding option A:

(x-2)(x+2)(x-1)(x+1) = [(x-2)(x+2)][(x-1)(x+1)] = (x^2 -4)(x^2 -1). Then, in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), 4= -1, so (x^2 +1)(x^2 -1) = x^4 -1, which is \( x^4 +4 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). So, yes, option A is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
