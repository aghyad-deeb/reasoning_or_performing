Okay, so I have this question about relations on a set A, where A is {1, 2, 3}. The relation S is given as {(1, 1), (2, 2)}. I need to figure out what kind of relation S is, and the options are: symmetric only, anti-symmetric only, both symmetric and anti-symmetric, or an equivalence relation.

First, I should recall what each of these terms means. Let me start by jotting down the definitions.

A relation S on a set A is symmetric if whenever (a, b) is in S, then (b, a) is also in S. So symmetry is about the relation being reflexive and consistent in that order.

Anti-symmetry is a bit different. For a relation S, if (a, b) and (b, a) are both in S, then it must be that a = b. So anti-symmetry prevents distinct elements from being related to each other in both orders.

An equivalence relation must satisfy three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. So if S is an equivalence relation, it should have all three.

Now, looking at S = {(1,1), (2,2)}. Let's check each property.

First, reflexivity. For every element a in A, is (a, a) in S? Yes, both (1,1) and (2,2) are present. So reflexivity holds.

Next, symmetry. For every (a, b) in S, is (b, a) also in S? Well, in S, we have (1,1) and (2,2). So for (1,1), swapping gives (1,1), which is in S. Same with (2,2). So symmetry holds because there are no cases where (a, b) is present with a ≠ b, so there's no need to check for the converse.

Now, anti-symmetry. The definition says that if (a, b) and (b, a) are both in S, then a must equal b. In S, we don't have any pairs where a ≠ b, except for the same elements. So, since there are no such pairs where a ≠ b, the condition is trivially satisfied. So anti-symmetry holds because there's no violation.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. If a relation has both symmetry and anti-symmetry, does that make sense? Because symmetry allows for (a, b) and (b, a), but anti-symmetry says that if both exist, then a = b. So in essence, symmetry and anti-symmetry together imply that the only allowed pairs are where a = b. So S satisfies both.

But wait, does S satisfy both? Let me think. If S has (a, a) for all a, then reflexivity holds. Also, since there are no (a, b) with a ≠ b, symmetry holds because there's nothing to violate it. Similarly, anti-symmetry holds because there's no case where (a, b) and (b, a) are both present with a ≠ b.

So S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric. But wait, can a relation be both symmetric and anti-symmetric?

Yes, actually. If the only pairs in the relation are the diagonal elements where a = b, then it's both symmetric and anti-symmetric because there's no way to have distinct a and b where both (a, b) and (b, a) are present. So in that case, symmetry holds trivially, and anti-symmetry also holds.

So S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric. Therefore, the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me check the definitions again.

Symmetric: For all a, b in A, if (a, b) is in S, then (b, a) is in S.

Anti-symmetric: For all a, b in A, if (a, b) and (b, a) are in S, then a = b.

In S, since there are no (a, b) where a ≠ b, both properties hold. So yes, S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric.

Also, is S an equivalence relation? Well, an equivalence relation needs reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. We've checked reflexivity and symmetry. Now, what about transitivity?

Transitivity requires that if (a, b) and (b, c) are in S, then (a, c) is in S.

In S, the only pairs are (1,1) and (2,2). So if I take (1,1) and (1,1), then (1,1) is in S. Similarly, (2,2) and (2,2) gives (2,2). So transitivity holds because there's no case where (a, b) and (b, c) exist with a ≠ c.

Wait, but actually, in S, the only pairs are the reflexive ones, so there are no cases where (a, b) and (b, c) exist unless a = b = c. So transitivity is trivially satisfied.

Therefore, S is also an equivalence relation because it has reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

Wait, so now I'm confused. Earlier, I thought it's both symmetric and anti-symmetric, which is option C. But now, considering it's also an equivalence relation, which is option D.

Hmm. So I need to reconcile this.

An equivalence relation requires reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. S has all three, so it's an equivalence relation.

But S is also both symmetric and anti-symmetric because the only pairs are reflexive, so there's no issue with symmetry or anti-symmetry.

Wait, but is S both symmetric and anti-symmetric? Let me think again.

Symmetric: For every (a, b) in S, (b, a) is in S. Since all elements are reflexive, this holds.

Anti-symmetric: If (a, b) and (b, a) are in S, then a = b. Since all pairs are reflexive, this holds.

So S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, and also an equivalence relation. So both C and D seem correct.

But wait, the options are A, B, C, D, and C is "both symmetric and anti-symmetric", D is "an equivalence relation".

So which one is the correct answer? Because S is both an equivalence relation and it's both symmetric and anti-symmetric.

Wait, but in the context of the question, it's asking what kind of relation S is, and the options include both possibilities. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple answers. Wait, the options are A, B, C, D, so only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

An equivalence relation is a special case of a relation that is symmetric, reflexive, and transitive. So if S is an equivalence relation, then it must be symmetric. But in this case, S is also anti-symmetric because the only pairs are reflexive.

But is S an equivalence relation? Yes, because reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity all hold.

So perhaps the correct answer is D, an equivalence relation.

But wait, earlier I thought that being both symmetric and anti-symmetric is also correct. So which one is it?

Let me look up the definitions again.

Symmetric: For all a, b in A, if (a, b) ∈ S, then (b, a) ∈ S.

Anti-symmetric: For all a, b in A, if (a, b) ∈ S and (b, a) ∈ S, then a = b.

Equivalence relation: Reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

So S has reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, so it's an equivalence relation. Additionally, since it only has reflexive pairs, it's also both symmetric and anti-symmetric.

But the options are:

A. symmetric only

B. anti-symmetric only

C. both symmetric and anti-symmetric

D. an equivalence relation

So S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric (C) and also an equivalence relation (D). But the options don't allow for both C and D. So perhaps the answer is both C and D, but since the options are separate, I have to choose the most accurate one.

Wait, but in the context of relations, when a relation is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, it's only possible if it's the diagonal, i.e., only (a, a) are in S. So in that case, it's both symmetric and anti-symmetric, and also an equivalence relation.

Therefore, S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric and also an equivalence relation. But the options don't have an option that combines both C and D. So perhaps the answer is both C and D, but since the options are separate, the correct answer is D because it's an equivalence relation, which already includes being symmetric and anti-symmetric.

Wait, but no, an equivalence relation doesn't necessarily have to be anti-symmetric. It just needs to be symmetric and transitive. So if a relation is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, it's a special case of an equivalence relation.

Wait, but actually, no. Equivalence relations are symmetric, but they don't have to be anti-symmetric. So if a relation is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, it's an equivalence relation because it's symmetric, reflexive, and transitive. But in this case, S is also anti-symmetric because it doesn't have any pairs where a ≠ b.

So perhaps the correct answer is both C and D, but since the options don't allow that, I have to choose the most precise answer.

Wait, the question is asking what relation S is, and the options are:

A. symmetric only

B. anti-symmetric only

C. both symmetric and anti-symmetric

D. an equivalence relation

So S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, which is C. But S is also an equivalence relation, which is D.

But the options don't have an option that says both C and D. So perhaps the answer is D because it's an equivalence relation, which is a broader category that includes being symmetric and anti-symmetric.

But wait, no, because in this case, S is specifically both symmetric and anti-symmetric. So perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of it this way: If a relation is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, then it's an equivalence relation. Because it's symmetric and transitive (since it's also anti-symmetric, which in this case implies transitivity).

Wait, no, transitivity isn't directly implied by anti-symmetry. But in this specific case, because S only has reflexive pairs, it's transitive.

So perhaps S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, making it an equivalence relation.

But in general, a relation can be symmetric without being anti-symmetric, and vice versa. But in this specific case, it's both.

So the answer should be both C and D, but since the options are separate, perhaps the most precise answer is C because it's specifically both symmetric and anti-symmetric, which is a more specific property.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

If a relation is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, then it's an equivalence relation. So perhaps the answer is D.

But wait, no. Equivalence relations are symmetric, but they don't have to be anti-symmetric. So if a relation is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, it's a special case of an equivalence relation, but it's not necessarily the case that all equivalence relations are both symmetric and anti-symmetric.

So in this specific case, S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, and also an equivalence relation. So the correct answer would be both C and D.

But since the options don't allow for multiple answers, I have to choose the most accurate one.

Wait, the question is phrased as "what relation S is", and the options are:

A. symmetric only

B. anti-symmetric only

C. both symmetric and anti-symmetric

D. an equivalence relation

So S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, which is option C. But S is also an equivalence relation, which is option D.

But the options don't allow for selecting both C and D. So perhaps the answer is D because it's an equivalence relation, which is a more comprehensive property.

Wait, but in reality, S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, so it's a more precise answer. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of an example.

If S is {(1,1), (2,2)}, then:

- Symmetry: Yes, because for each (a,a), (a,a) is present.

- Anti-symmetry: Yes, because there are no (a,b) and (b,a) with a≠b.

- Reflexivity: Yes.

- Transitivity: Yes, because there are no cases where (a,b) and (b,c) exist with a≠c.

So S is an equivalence relation, and it's also both symmetric and anti-symmetric.

Therefore, the correct answer is both C and D. But since the options don't allow that, perhaps the answer is D because it's an equivalence relation, which encompasses being symmetric and anti-symmetric.

Wait, no, because being an equivalence relation doesn't necessarily mean it's both symmetric and anti-symmetric. It just needs to be symmetric and transitive.

So in this case, S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, which makes it an equivalence relation. So the answer is D because it's an equivalence relation, which is a broader category that includes being symmetric and anti-symmetric.

But the options don't allow for selecting both C and D. So perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, but the question is asking specifically whether it's symmetric only, anti-symmetric only, both, or an equivalence relation.

Since S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, the correct answer is C.

But I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to look up if a relation can be both symmetric and anti-symmetric.

Yes, it's possible. For example, the identity relation on a set is both symmetric and anti-symmetric because it only contains pairs where a = b.

So in this case, S is the identity relation on A, which is both symmetric and anti-symmetric.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.

But since S is also an equivalence relation, perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, no, because the question is asking what kind of relation S is, and the options are:

A. symmetric only

B. anti-symmetric only

C. both symmetric and anti-symmetric

D. an equivalence relation

So S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric (C) and also an equivalence relation (D). But since the options are separate, the most accurate answer is C because it's specifically both symmetric and anti-symmetric, which is a more precise description.

Therefore, the answer is C.
