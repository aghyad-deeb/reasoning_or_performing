Okay, so I've got this question here about group theory, and I need to figure out if two statements are true or false. Let me start by recalling what I know about groups because it's been a while since I studied this.

First, a group in mathematics is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element, satisfying certain axioms like closure, associativity, identity, and inverses. Now, the question is about two statements involving group theory.

Statement 1 says: In a group, (ab)^-2 equals b^-2 a^-2. Hmm, let's parse that. The inverse of a product is the product of the inverses in reverse order, right? So, (ab)^-1 should be b^-1 a^-1. If that's the case, then squaring both sides, (ab)^-2 would be (b^-1 a^-1)(b^-1 a^-1). But wait, that's not the same as b^-2 a^-2. Let me write that out:

(ab)^-2 = (ab)^-1 * (ab)^-1 = (b^-1 a^-1)(b^-1 a^-1) = b^-1 a^-1 b^-1 a^-1.

On the other hand, b^-2 a^-2 is just b^-1 b^-1 a^-1 a^-1. Since group multiplication is associative, we can rearrange the terms, but I don't think they'll cancel out to the same thing. For example, if we have b^-1 a^-1 b^-1 a^-1, that's not the same as b^-2 a^-2 because the a^-1 is in the middle of the two b^-1s.

Wait, maybe I should consider a specific example to test this. Let's take the group of integers under addition, but wait, that's abelian. Maybe a non-abelian group would be better. Let's think of symmetric group S3. In S3, the elements are permutations, and the group is non-abelian.

Let me pick two elements, say (1 2 3) and (1 2). Their product is (1 2 3)(1 2) = (1 3). Now, let's compute (ab)^-2. First, (ab) is (1 3), so its inverse is (1 3) inverse. In S3, the inverse of (1 2 3) is (1 3 2), and the inverse of (1 2) is (1 2). So, (ab)^-1 is (1 3)(1 3 2). Wait, no, that's not right. The inverse of (1 3) is (1 3) itself because applying it twice gives the identity. So, (ab)^-1 is (1 3)(1 3 2). Let me compute that:

(1 3)(1 3 2) = (1 3)(1 3 2). Let's compute step by step. Apply (1 3 2) first, which sends 1→1, 2→3, 3→2. Then apply (1 3), which swaps 1 and 3. So, starting with 1: (1 3 2) sends 1 to 1, then (1 3) sends 1 to 3. So overall, 1→3. For 2: (1 3 2) sends 2 to 3, then (1 3) sends 3 to 1. So 2→1. For 3: (1 3 2) sends 3 to 2, then (1 3) sends 2 to 2. So 3→2. So the permutation is (1 3 2), which is the inverse of (1 2 3).

Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should use a different approach. Let me compute (ab)^-2. Since (ab) is (1 3), its inverse is itself, so (ab)^-1 is (1 3). Then (ab)^-2 is (ab)(ab) = (1 3)(1 3). Let's compute that: (1 3)(1 3) is the identity permutation because swapping twice brings you back. So (ab)^-2 is the identity.

Now, let's compute b^-2 a^-2. Here, a is (1 2 3) and b is (1 2). So a^-1 is (1 3 2) and b^-1 is (1 2). So b^-2 is (1 2)(1 2), which is the identity. a^-2 is (1 3 2)(1 3 2). Let's compute that: (1 3 2)(1 3 2). Applying (1 3 2) twice: first, it sends 1→1, 2→3, 3→2. Then again, same permutation: 1→1, 2→3, 3→2. So overall, it's the identity. Therefore, b^-2 a^-2 is the identity * identity = identity.

Wait, so in this case, both (ab)^-2 and b^-2 a^-2 are the identity, so they are equal. But that's just one example. Maybe I should try another example where the elements don't commute.

Let me pick another pair of permutations in S3. Let a = (1 2 3) and b = (1 3 2). Their product ab is (1 2 3)(1 3 2). Let's compute that: apply (1 3 2) first, which sends 1→1, 2→3, 3→2. Then apply (1 2 3), which sends 1→2, 2→3, 3→1. So overall, 1→2, 2→3, 3→1. So ab is (1 2 3).

Now, (ab)^-2. Since ab is (1 2 3), its inverse is (1 3 2). So (ab)^-2 is (ab)(ab) = (1 2 3)(1 2 3). Let's compute that: (1 2 3)(1 2 3). Applying (1 2 3) twice: 1→2, then 2→3, so 1→3. 3→1, then 1→2, so 3→2. 2→3, then 3→1, so 2→1. So the permutation is (1 3 2), which is the inverse of (1 2 3).

Now, let's compute b^-2 a^-2. Here, b is (1 3 2), so b^-1 is (1 2 3). a is (1 2 3), so a^-1 is (1 3 2). So b^-2 is (1 3 2)(1 3 2). As before, that's the identity. a^-2 is (1 2 3)(1 2 3), which is (1 3 2). So b^-2 a^-2 is identity * (1 3 2) = (1 3 2). But (ab)^-2 is (1 3 2). So in this case, they are equal again.

Wait, maybe I'm not picking good examples. Let me try with different elements where the inverses might not commute. Maybe in a different group, like the symmetric group S4 or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the general case without relying on specific examples. Let's recall that in a group, (ab)^-1 = b^-1 a^-1. So (ab)^-2 = (ab)^-1 (ab)^-1 = (b^-1 a^-1)(b^-1 a^-1). Now, group multiplication is associative, so we can rearrange the terms: b^-1 a^-1 b^-1 a^-1. But in general, this is not the same as b^-2 a^-2, which would be b^-1 b^-1 a^-1 a^-1. The difference is the position of a^-1 in the first case versus the second.

So, unless the group is abelian, these two expressions might not be equal. Wait, but in the examples I tried in S3, which is non-abelian, they were equal. So maybe in non-abelian groups, sometimes they can be equal, but not always. Or perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In S3, for the first example, (ab)^-2 was identity, and b^-2 a^-2 was also identity. In the second example, (ab)^-2 was (1 3 2), and b^-2 a^-2 was (1 3 2). So in both cases, they were equal. Maybe in S3, it's always true. Let me test another pair.

Let me take a = (1 2) and b = (1 3). Their product ab is (1 2)(1 3) = (1 3 2). So (ab)^-1 is (1 2 3). Then (ab)^-2 is (ab)(ab) = (1 3 2)(1 3 2). Applying (1 3 2) twice: 1→3→1, 3→2→3, 2→2. So (ab)^-2 is the identity.

Now, b^-2 a^-2: b is (1 3), so b^-1 is (1 3), and b^-2 is identity. a is (1 2), so a^-1 is (1 2), and a^-2 is identity. So b^-2 a^-2 is identity * identity = identity. So again, they are equal.

Hmm, maybe in S3, it's always true. But that's just a specific group. Let me think about a different group, maybe the quaternion group or something else.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the original statement. The statement says (ab)^-2 = b^-2 a^-2. Let me write it again: (ab)^{-2} = b^{-2} a^{-2}. So, is this always true in any group?

From the general group theory, we know that (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}, so squaring both sides would give (ab)^{-2} = (b^{-1}a^{-1})(b^{-1}a^{-1}) = b^{-1}a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}. On the other hand, b^{-2}a^{-2} is b^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}a^{-1}.

So, unless the group is abelian, these two expressions are not necessarily equal. Because in the first case, a^{-1} is in the middle of two b^{-1}s, while in the second case, a^{-1} is at the end.

Wait, but in S3, they seem to be equal. So perhaps in some non-abelian groups, this holds, but not in others. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it algebraically. Let me denote the group operation as multiplication. Then, (ab)^{-2} = (ab)(ab)^{-1} = a b a^{-1} b^{-1}. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify: (ab)^{-2} is (ab)^{-1}(ab)^{-1} = (b^{-1}a^{-1})(b^{-1}a^{-1}) = b^{-1}a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}.

On the other hand, b^{-2}a^{-2} is b^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}a^{-1}. So, unless the group is abelian, these two expressions are not equal because the order of multiplication matters. So in non-abelian groups, (ab)^{-2} ≠ b^{-2}a^{-2}.

But in my examples in S3, they were equal. So maybe in some non-abelian groups, they are equal, but not in others. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the examples.

Wait, in S3, let's take another example. Let a = (1 2), b = (1 3 2). Then ab = (1 2)(1 3 2). Let's compute ab: apply (1 3 2) first, which sends 1→1, 2→3, 3→2. Then apply (1 2), which swaps 1 and 2. So starting with 1: (1 3 2) sends 1→1, then (1 2) sends 1→2. So 1→2. For 2: (1 3 2) sends 2→3, then (1 2) leaves 3 unchanged. So 2→3. For 3: (1 3 2) sends 3→2, then (1 2) sends 2→1. So 3→1. So ab is (1 2 3).

Now, (ab)^-2: since ab is (1 2 3), its inverse is (1 3 2). So (ab)^-2 is (ab)(ab) = (1 2 3)(1 2 3). Applying (1 2 3) twice: 1→2→3, 2→3→1, 3→1→2. So (1 2 3)(1 2 3) is (1 3 2).

Now, let's compute b^-2 a^-2. b is (1 3 2), so b^-1 is (1 2 3). b^-2 is (1 2 3)(1 2 3) = (1 3 2). a is (1 2), so a^-1 is (1 2). a^-2 is (1 2)(1 2) = identity. So b^-2 a^-2 is (1 3 2) * identity = (1 3 2).

So in this case, (ab)^-2 is (1 3 2), and b^-2 a^-2 is (1 3 2). They are equal again. Hmm, so maybe in S3, it's always true. But that's confusing because in general, (ab)^-2 should not equal b^-2 a^-2 unless the group is abelian.

Wait, but S3 is non-abelian, yet in all my examples, (ab)^-2 equals b^-2 a^-2. Maybe I'm not seeing the issue. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe in S3, the square of any element is the identity. Because S3 has order 6, and elements have orders 1, 2, or 3. So, for elements of order 2, their square is identity. So when I compute (ab)^-2, it's the same as (ab)(ab), which for elements of order 2, would be identity. Similarly, b^-2 is identity, and a^-2 is identity if a has order 2. So in S3, if both a and b have order 2, then (ab)^-2 is identity, and b^-2 a^-2 is also identity. But if a has order 3, then a^-2 is not identity.

Wait, in my previous examples, I was using elements of order 2, so their squares were identity. Let me try with elements of order 3.

Let me take a = (1 2 3), which has order 3. Its inverse is (1 3 2). Let b = (1 2), which has order 2. Then ab = (1 2 3)(1 2) = (1 3). So (ab)^-1 is (1 3), and (ab)^-2 is (1 3)(1 3) = identity.

Now, b^-2 is identity, and a^-2 is (1 2 3)(1 2 3) = (1 3 2). So b^-2 a^-2 is identity * (1 3 2) = (1 3 2). But (ab)^-2 is identity, so they are not equal. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, in this case, (ab)^-2 is identity, and b^-2 a^-2 is (1 3 2). So they are not equal. That contradicts my earlier conclusion. So in S3, sometimes (ab)^-2 equals b^-2 a^-2, and sometimes not. So the original statement that (ab)^-2 = b^-2 a^-2 is not always true in a group, even in S3.

Wait, but in the first example where a and b were both of order 2, (ab)^-2 was identity, and b^-2 a^-2 was also identity. But when a had order 3 and b had order 2, they were not equal. So the statement is not universally true in S3. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: In a group, (ab)^n = a^n b^n. Let's see. For positive integers n, this would be true if the group is abelian, because then (ab)^n = a^n b^n. But in non-abelian groups, this is not necessarily true.

For example, in S3, let's take a = (1 2 3) and b = (1 3 2). Then ab = (1 2 3)(1 3 2) = (1 2). Now, let's compute (ab)^2. (ab)^2 = abab = (1 2)(1 2 3)(1 3 2)(1 2). Let's compute step by step.

First, apply (1 2): swaps 1 and 2.

Then apply (1 3 2): sends 1→1, 2→3, 3→2.

Then apply (1 2 3): sends 1→2, 2→3, 3→1.

Then apply (1 2): swaps 1 and 2.

Let's track where each element goes:

1: after (1 2): 2

Then (1 3 2): 2→3

Then (1 2 3): 3→1

Then (1 2): 1→2

So overall, 1→2.

2: after (1 2): 1

Then (1 3 2): 1→1

Then (1 2 3): 1→2

Then (1 2): 2→1

So 2→1.

3: after (1 2): 3

Then (1 3 2): 3→2

Then (1 2 3): 2→3

Then (1 2): 3→3

So 3→3.

So overall, (ab)^2 is (1 2), which is the same as ab.

Wait, but ab is (1 2). So (ab)^2 = ab. That's interesting. Let's check if a^n b^n equals (ab)^n.

Compute a^2 b^2. a^2 is (1 2 3)(1 2 3) = (1 3 2). b^2 is (1 3 2)(1 3 2) = identity. So a^2 b^2 = (1 3 2) * identity = (1 3 2).

But (ab)^2 is (1 2), which is different from a^2 b^2 = (1 3 2). So in this case, (ab)^n ≠ a^n b^n.

Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but in this case, (ab)^n equals ab, which is of order 2, but a^n b^n is (1 3 2), which is different. So yes, Statement 2 is false.

Alternatively, let's think about the general case. In a non-abelian group, (ab)^n is not necessarily equal to a^n b^n. For example, in S3, (ab)^n can be ab, whereas a^n b^n could be different. So Statement 2 is false.

So, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is false. Therefore, the answer should be B: False, False.

The statements are both false.
